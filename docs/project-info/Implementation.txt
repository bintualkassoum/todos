== Gathering Results

To evaluate the success of the AI To-Do List App, we will gather results based on the following criteria:
- User feedback on ease of use and functionality.
- Performance metrics such as task execution time and system responsiveness.
- Adoption rate and user engagement over the first month of release.
- Error rates and bug reports post-deployment.

Continuous monitoring and user feedback collection will help refine the app and prioritize future enhancements.
